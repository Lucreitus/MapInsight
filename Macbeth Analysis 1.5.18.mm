      As one of King Duncan's chief generals and closest military advisers, Macbeth is led to perform wicked deeds by the prophecies of three witches and the machinations of his wife. When he is pronounced Thane of Cawdor for his military victories &#8211; a prophecy come true before his ascension to the kingship &#8211; he is tempted into murder to fulfill the second prophecy. One he is crowned king, his brutal plans are made all the easier as he begins killing indiscriminately to ensure his throne. He is not subtle, nor effective as he riles the entire Scottish nobility against his tyrannous ways and ultimately falls before the might of his own psychological pressure and the might of his opposition.

      As Macbeth's wife, Lady Macbeth is the early instigator of the atrocious plans that lead to Macbeth's Kingship. She is ambitious and power hungry and her machinations are as cold and vicious as her husband's actions. However, after the bloodshed begins she is incapable of bearing the weight of what she has done and soon falls victim to the weight of her guilt, eventually going mad and committing suicide. Despite the horrible nature of her and her husband's crimes, the two are a very close couple very much so in love.

      There are three witches, plotting mischief against Macbeth through their prophecy and spells. Their predictions are responsible for prompting him to murder Duncan and Banquo, and give him cause to believe his is invincible later on. There are no details as to the origin or nature of the witches, other than that they serve Hecate. Numerous similarities between them and mythological beings have been drawn, but none are of clear relation

      A second of Duncan's generals, he is with Macbeth when the witches tell their first prophecy, foretelling his children to inherit the throne. He is equally ambitious, but does not take the action that Macbeth does in securing his ambitions. Rather, he is the path not chosen, that of inaction and decency. His ghost later haunts Macbeth accordingly for his murder, reminding Macbeth of the choices he made.

      King Duncan is attended by a captain recently wounded while saving Duncan's son Malcolm from capture by the Irish. He tells Duncan of how Macbeth and Banquo, the two generals, have defeated the Irish and Norwegian armies and how Macbeth had vanquished and killed the traitor Macdonald. The Thane of Ross soon enters and tells Duncan of how the Thane of Cawdor defected and joined the Norwegian forces to fight against the Scottish. Duncan announces that Macbeth shall take the role of Thane of Cawdor as a reward for having led the victorious army in battle. Ross departs to share the news with Macbeth.

      The witches reappear on the moor, discussing their powers and the recent acts they've managed to complete, one describing her killing swine and another who has planned revenge upon a sailor whose wife did not properly share chestnuts. Macbeth and Banquo soon appear and are addressed by the three witches. They address Macbeth at first as the Thane of Glamis and then as the Thane of Cawdor. Confused by their statements, Macbeth is further confused when they announce that he will one day be the King of Scotland. As a third prophecy, they announce that Banquo is at the same time lesser and greater than Macbeth and that his sons will sit on the throne but that he will not. The two discuss the prophecies with each other, confused by the encounter until Ross arrives to bring them to the king. He announces to Macbeth that he has been made Thane of Cawdor. Immediately Macbeth begins musing on how the first prophecy came true, asking of Banquo if he would enjoy his sons as kings. Banquo's response is tempered more than Macbeth's, saying that these things are often only half truths. Macbeth begins to ponder exactly what the prophecy might mean and whether he could one day be king

      Macbeth goes about pondering the act that he has nearly decided to do. He thinks on the nature of the deed, wondering if it's right to kill a man who is his king and his guest. He thinks on how popular the king is and how virtuous he is and eventually decides that the only reason to kill the king is to serve his own ambitions. When Lady Macbeth reenters the room and Macbeth announces that he's decided against killing the King, to which she immediately attacks him and his manhood. He asks of the consequences and she declares that they will be fine so long as they remain resolute in their determination. Her plan is to bribe the King's chamberlains with drink and get them drunk enough that they forget themselves and give up easy access to the King's chambers. After they are sufficiently drunk, they will sneak in and kill the king, then smear the blood on the drunken chamberlains so as to lay the blame at someone else's feet. Finally, Macbeth consents, remarking that he hopes their children are male, lest another female such as Lady Macbeth with her &#8220;undaunted mettle&#8221; is born.

      Macbeth is on his way to the King's chambers and along the way is confronted by Banquo and his son Fleance. The two are up late, unable to sleep and Banquo explains to Macbeth that his dreams are plagued by the witches and their prophecies. The two discuss the sisters and when Banquo asks if they have revealed some &#8220;truth&#8221; to Macbeth, he replies that he has not thought on their words at all. They once again agree to talk on the matter later and they part ways. Macbeth proceeds carefully and immediately sees a dagger floating in the air pointing towards Duncan's bed chambers. The dagger appears to have blood on it and when Macbeth grasps at it, he cannot take hold. He decides that it must be a manifestation of his unease over killing the King and realizes how dark and foreboding the night around him is. Finally, he hears the bell rung by Lady Macbeth signaling that the Chamberlains are sufficiently drunk.

      Lady Macbeth appears after Macbeth has left on comments on how clever she is. She ponders Macbeth's cry in the dark and the fact that he could easily have made a mistake. She muses on how she could have killed the King herself when preparing the daggers for the chamberlains, but could not because he looked so much like her father sleeping. When finally Macbeth returns, his hands are bloodied and he is visibly shaken. He notes how he heard the chamberlains wake and say a prayer, unable himself to say Amen to the prayer. He also notes how he believed he heard a voice invoke his crime after he had killed the king. At first Lady Macbeth tries to sooth her husband but soon becomes angry after realizing that he failed to leave the daggers on the chamberlains to frame them for the murder. He refuses to go back to the room again, forcing her to plant the daggers herself. He begins to hear knocking on the doors, sure that he's been found out and begins worrying of his horrible deed. She finally returns and takes him to wash the blood from his hands, stating ironically that a simple wash of the hands clears them of the deed.

      The porter of the castle allows the knocking to continue for some time longer, musing on how he would porter the gates of hell and who he would let in. He finally opens the door to let in Lennox and Macduff, having arrived to prepare the King for departure. Macbeth is one of the few people in the castle still awake and leads the two men to the king's bed chambers where they discover that the King has been murdered and the news spreads quickly. Everyone arrives, including Lady Macbeth, Duncan's sons, and the other nobles and chaos ensues. Finally Macbeth arrives again and declares that he has killed the two chamberlains who are responsible in his rage. Macduff declares his own wariness of the two new deaths, while Macbeth professes his fury at the death of his king as motivation for their execution. Lady Macbeth faints suddenly and is rushed free of the stage. Malcolm and Donalbian whisper to each other that they must flee to stay safe from the murderer as who ever killed their father will likely desire their deaths as well. Banquo and Macbeth gather the nobles and prepare to meet and discuss the matter of Duncan's death.

He describes the owl that killed the falcon and the king's well trained horses eating each other. The day itself is dark and the two are properly quieted by the mood. Macduff soon enters the seen and tells Ross that Macbeth has been made King and that he will soon ride to Scone to be crowned. Because of the departure of the sons so soon after the king's murder there is suspicion that they may have paid off the chamberlains to kill the king. Macduff announces that he will return to his home in Fife and Ross sets out for Scone to see to the coronation.

      Banquo enters and muses on the prophecies of the three witches. The first two have come true now and so he wonders if the third might be a possibility and that his sons will some day sit on the throne. The stir of ambition begins to appear for Banquo as Macbeth and Lady Macbeth in their royal attire appear, inviting Banquo to the feast for the evening. Banquo accepts and tells Macbeth of the ride he plans to go on later that day. Macbeth mentions to Banquo that they must discuss the matter of Duncan's sons who have fled and are likely plotting against the crown. Banquo leaves the room and Macbeth discusses a few smaller matters of state with his servant before he departs as well. At this point, Macbeth begins a soliloquy on the matter of Banquo and the succession. He worries that he will not produce an heir and that Banquo's sons will overthrow him later, taking the throne as the witches foresaw. Macbeth's servant reenters with the murderers he has hired and reminds them of the &#8220;wrongs&#8221; committed against them by Banquo and they agree once more to kill Macbeth's former comrade. He reminds them to also kill Fleance, Banquo's son and they depart.

Directly before the feast, Macbeth is approached by the murderers and told of what has happened with Banquo and his son. He recomposes himself and returns to the feast where he raises an imaginary toast to his friend. He then sees the ghost of Banquo and much like with the visage of the dagger, he starts to feel the pressure of the acts he has performed and their relevant effects on his life. He is at alternating times courageous and depressed, unsure of himself and losing his tenuous grip on reality. Lady Macbeth attempts to sooth him, sending away the noblemen and trying to calm him Macbeth however is already planning to murder Macduff and declares his intentions to go and see the three witches once more for advice and prophecies. He decides that Macduff's actions border on treason as he plans to stay away from court and keep his own counsel.

      Upon his return to the three witches, Macbeth demands a series of apparitions to help him discern his future. The witches comply by offering him three such visions. The first is a disembodied head, bloodied and reminding Macbeth of Macduff, warning Macbeth to beware the fled nobleman. The second is a blood soaked child who comforts Macbeth that he cannot be killed by any man born of woman. The final apparition is a child wearing a crown who says Macbeth will be king until the Birnam wood comes to Dunsinane. Macbeth is encouraged and lightened by this news and asks whether Banquo's sons will succeed him. The witches respond with an apparition of the procession of kings, with the final king carrying a mirror and the procession ended with Banquo's ghost. The witches then vanish and Lennox enters with news that Macduff has fled for England. Macbeth decides that he will capture Macduff's castle and kill his family

He begins to declare how he is unfit for the crown, listing his vices and his issues with leadership. Macduff eventually breaks down and announces that Malcolm is indeed unfit to rule the country, proving that he is loyal. Malcolm then announces that he was lying to Macduff and that the latter has proven himself. Soon afterward, Ross arrives and tells the two that everything is well with Macduff's family and that they should return to Scotland to see to the country since it has gone into such disarray with Macbeth as the king. When Malcolm announces that he will only return with 10,000 English troops, Ross breaks down and admits that Macduff's family has been murdered. Macduff, crushed with grief, is urged by Malcolm to turn his grief to anger and unleash it upon Macbeth.

      A doctor and a waiting-gentlewoman discuss Lady Macbeth's recent habit of sleepwalking. She enters in yet another bemoaned state and begins to wail about the deaths of Banquo and Lady Macduff. She claims there is blood on her hands and that she cannot wash it free. As she walks away, the doctor and waiting-woman discuss Lady Macbeth's descent into madness.

      Beyond the castle gates, the Scottish lords are discussing the approaching English forces. The Scottish forces themselves will meet up with Malcolm and Macduff at the Birnam Wood. Macbeth, the tyrant as they refer to him, has gone into a rage, fortifying the castle at Dunsinane.

      Macbeth appears with his doctor in tow, claiming he cannot die because no man born of woman can kill him and he cannot lose because the Birnam Wood cannot physically move. He insists on wearing his armor hours before the battle and raves madly at his servants when they announce the arrival of 10,000 English troops. When the doctor announces that Lady Macbeth is struck with delusions, Macbeth tells him to cure her of them.

Macduff appears from the battle, searching frantically for Macbeth, wanting to personally see to his death. He then disappears back into the battle. Malcolm and Siward arrive again and enter the castle. Macbeth and Macduff finally confront each other and fight. Macbeth announces that no man can kill him of a woman's womb. However, Macduff announces that he was torn from his mother's womb (through surgery) and Macbeth immediately fears for his life, but will not surrender to Macduff. The two exit the stage fighting. Malcolm and Siward enter the castle after conquering it and confront Ross with the news that Macbeth has killed Siward's son.
